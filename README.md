# Some useful Nutanix scripts 

## Getting Started

These scripts are created with intention to help  Nutanix SRE(Site Reliabilty Engineer), SE(System Engineer) and administrator to manage/deploy/config/troubleshoot Nutanix HCI environment.

### Prerequisites

Need to understand basic bash script syntax and Nutanix cluster components.

```
Prims Element? Data service IP?
```

### How to run each script !
Just download with git clone then run the shell script with sh command from any linux base system - Mac,Centos,Ubuntu etc
```
ex) $sh int_auto_script.sh
```

### Detail on each script
# 
1. init_auto_script.sh

This script will ask Prism Element IP to congfigure various information by one command. 

Prerequistes
- Updated `auto_script.sh` base on your environment and located in same directory
  	
  	ex) Network pool/vlan configuration,ntp,data service ip etc

- nutanix user ssh public key must exist with Prism Element via API or Prism Console

  	API: https://www.nutanix.dev/reference/prism_element/v2/api/cluster/post-cluster-public-keys-addpublickey
